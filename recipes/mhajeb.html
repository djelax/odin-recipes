 <h4>Preparation:</h4>
 <ol>
  <li>Mhajeb Dough:</li>
   <p>
    To prepare your Algerian mhadjeb, add the semolina and salt in a standing mixer bowl fitted with dough hook. Mix the ingredients on the lowest setting, adding enough water until a dough forms.
    Then, turn the setting to knead and let it run for 10 minutes, sprinkling the dough with water every minute. See the mhadjeb sauce instructions now.
    After 10 minutes, pull the dough off the hook and push back into bowl. Continue to knead using the mixer, watering for another 5 to 10 minutes until you have a soft and elastic dough.
    Now divide the dough. Coat the baking tray and your hands with oil, pull off handfuls of dough, and place on the tray. Pat the dough tops with a little oil, loosely cover with cling film and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes.

  <li>Mhajeb Sauce:</li> 
   <p>
    When you are not sprinkling the dough with water, prepare the mhadjeb sauce. Place a large pan on medium heat and heat some olive oil in it.
    Once hot enough, add the onion and stir fry until soft and translucent. Then add the garlic, spices (except the salt), tomato puree, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant.
    Then add the tomato, stir, and cook over low heat for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, transfer the sauce to a bowl, let cool, and then add freshly chopped coriander or parsley and salt.

  <li>Mhajeb Folding and Cooking:</li>
   <p>
    Preheat a pan or flat griddle on low heat (switch to medium when you want to cook the mhadjeb).
    Oil your hands and work the surface very well so the dough does not stick to it and your hands. Also, you will be cooking the flat breads in a dry hot pan, so you need to grease it.
    Start by getting 1 piece of dough and gently patting it with the palm of your hands until it has a flat square-like shape.
    Place your hand underneath one part and gently stretch from the middle outwards until it is thin and you can see the work surface underneath. Continue to stretch the mhadjeb dough all way around until it is even.
    Do not worry if you have a few little holes, since you will fold it over later. But try to get a consistent thin surface, you can cut off any thick edges with a pizza wheel. You can put back any excess cut offs on the baking tray covered for use later on.
    Add a tablespoon of cooled filling in the center of the dough and spread using the back of a spoon, leaving a big border of dough.
    Now fold the top side down over some of the sauce into the center, and then fold the bottom side up. Do the same with the right and left side so you have a square as the result.
    Carefully transfer the mahajeb with oiled hands to the pan or the grill and cook until each side is golden and crisp.
    Repeat the folding and cooking steps until all the dough has been used. Your mhadjeb is ready for serving.
